Arduino Simple CW Keyer

SimpleCWKeyer is an open source Arduino based CW (Morse Code) keyer based on PA3HCM and K3NG's design with basic features and flexibility, 
rivaling commercial keyers which often cost significantly more. 
The code can be used with a full blown Arduino board or an AVR microcontroller chip can be programmed and used directly in a circuit. 
It¡¯s open source code so you can fully customize it to fit your needs and also perhaps learn from it or find coding ideas for other projects.
